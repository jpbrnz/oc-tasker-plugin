#Manage Projects and Tasks in the Backend
This is a simple project manager for the October CMS backend. You can add projects, tasks, files, and track due and completed dates. This is just a simple package created while reviewing October CMS.

##Install
Extract this archive to `/plugins/jbdev/tasker` and click on **Projects** in the back-end area.

To insure correct setup you might want to run one or more of the following:

    php artisan plugin:refresh Jbdev.Tasker
    
    or
    
    php artisan october:up

This will seed the database and setup the plugin for use.

###October CMS
October CMS is still in beta as of publishing this plugin. I can say from first hand experience and review of the code, you can comfortably try this system out for your next project. The website includes fantastic documentation and the plugins look to be growing in number and creativity quickly. Technically you could build out your own custom module as well. Endless potential with this system.
